### Overview

Policer in networking are responsible for **metering** (Monitoring the rate of traffic) and **marking** (Flagging traffic that exceeds defined limits) traffic based on predefined criteria.
By applying policers to ACL rules, SONiC can effectively control the flow of network traffic, ensuring fairness, optimizing bandwidth utilization, and preventing network congestion.

Usage examples:
- **Security**: Policy-Based Metering can be used to guard against network storms or DDoS attacks by limiting traffic volumes.
- **Quality of Service (QoS)**: It helps in prioritizing critical traffic (like VoIP or video streams) while limiting less important traffic (such as bulk data transfers).
- **Data Centre**: ensure fair bandwidth distribution.

### Requirements
#### Functional Requirements
- Backward compatibility for existing ACL features - If policer is not set, the system will function as it did previously.
- Ability to config/remove/manage policers with ACL entries.
- Support policer types
	- **storm_control**: Used to prevent network storms by limiting the rate of broadcast, multicast, and unknown unicast traffic.
	- **srTCM (Single Rate Three Color Marker)**: Marks packets based on a single rate and three colors (green, yellow, red) to indicate compliance with the traffic profile.
	- **trTCM (Two Rate Three Color Marker)**: Marks packets based on two rates (committed and peak) and three colors to indicate compliance.
	- Support rate-limiting in terms of packets per second or bytes per second.
- Support all existing ACL types (ACL table types, ACL stages).
### Scalability Requirements:
- Support for multiple ACL entries with associated policers.
- Query and validate ASIC capabilities dynamically.
#### CLI Requirements
- Bind policers with ACL rules.
- Unbind policer from ACL rules.
- Show ACLs with policers
---
### Architecture Design

No SONiC architecture changes are required as the existing infrastructure is being used.

### Configuration and Management

#### Config DB Enhancements

##### Updated ACL Tables Table schema:
- The current SAI implementation requires an action list when a new ACL is created.
  Until this feature was introduced, only default actions were supported, so SONiC addressed this by sending a default action list (**defaultAclActionList**) per table type.
- Since a new action is added, ACL Tables Table schema will be updated with a new optional action-list field - **ext_actions_list** to accept list of actions, these actions in addition to defaultAclActionList will be used to creating ACL table.
- The list of actions will be augmented to the existing defaultAclActionList.
  For example, if user configuresÂ **ext_actions_list**=**POLICER**, **ACTION1** - the full action-list of that table will be \[\<**defaultAclActionList(table_type)**\>, **POLICER**, **ACTION1**\]
```
  key                  = ACL_TABLE:name                            ; acl_table_name must be unique
  ;field               = value                         
  policy_desc          = 1*255VCHAR                                ; name of the ACL policy table description
  type                 = 1*255VCHAR                                ; type of acl table, every table type
                                                                   ; defines a specific set of actions.
                                                                   ; posible types:

                                                                   ; table is applied, can be emtry
                                                                   ; value annotations
  port_name            = 1*64VCHAR                                 ; name of the port, must be unique

* ext_actions_list     = ["POLICER", "ACTION1", "ACTION2", ...]    ; additional action list - can be extended in the future with new actions
```
##### Updated ACL Rules Table schema:
- The ACL Rules Table schema will be updated with a new parameter "policer_name" with value of one of the existing policer object names.
  In addition, to make the existing actions behave more deterministic, they separated into groups that can be set 'undependably'.
- For example, you can set the actions
  \[**packet_action_policer**=True; **packet_action_do_not_nat**=True; **packet_action**="forward"\].
  This means that **not-NAT** packets will be **forward** after **policer** handling.

#### YANG Model Enhancements

Add 'policer' to sonic-yang-models/yang-templates/sonic-types.yang.j2:
```yang
typedef packet_action {
	type enumeration {
		enum DROP;
        enum ACCEPT;
        enum FORWARD;
        enum REDIRECT;
        enum DO_NOT_NAT;
        enum MIRROR;
      * enum POLICER;
    }
}
```

### Warmboot and Fastboot Design Impact
N/A

---
### Memory Consumption
N/A

---
### Restrictions/Limitations

- Policers must be supported
- Policer cannot be deleted when referenced by ACL rule.
- PRE-INGRESS stage isn't supported.
---
### Testing Requirements/Design
#### Unit Test Cases
- Test ACL-Orchagent and Policer-Orchagent logic for correct processing.
#### System Test Cases
- Ensure correct packet marking based on policer configurations.
- Warm/Fast reboot tests to check the changes do not break these features.
#### CLI Level Tests
- Verify command run successfully with valid parameter enable/disable.
-  Verify command abort with invalid policer parameter.
- Verify command output.
#### DB validation
- Verify CONFIG DB is correctly updated.
---
### Open/Action Items
- Are there specific ASIC platforms with limitations for this feature?
- ACL-Loader utility uses the an external python library (openconfig_acl) that rely on pre-defined, structured models. In order to support the new 'policer_action' per rule the openconfig_acl schema need to be changed.
